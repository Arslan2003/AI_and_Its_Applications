# AI_and_Its_Applications

The coursework required students to split into groups of 4 and develop various ML models for the topic of their choice. Our group chose the detection of money laudering in transational dataet after being inspired by IBM's Multi-GNN models which could transform transactional data into a graph and detect money laudering there. The team focused on maintaining the tabular format of the data and applying various ML models to achieve results comparable to those of IBM's. My chosen model was Feedforward Neural Network. The dataset used for this project was synthesised by IBM for their project and is the specific set called "HI-Small-Trans". IBM's entire study can be found on: https://github.com/IBM/Multi-GNN.
